 ### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Ward

ðŸš€ **Background:** Transitioning from an extensive background as an Estimator in the industrial and commercial roofing sector, Iâ€™m embarking on a new journey to embrace my passion for technology and software development starting with a full-stack software development course run by Northcoders. I've also started my journey on FreeCodeCamp currently going through the responsive web design certification. 

ðŸŽ® **Hobbies:** When I'm not learning to code, you can find me diving into video games, engrossed in a good book, bouldering, or hitting the gym.
